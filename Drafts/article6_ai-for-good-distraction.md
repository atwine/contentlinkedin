# Tech Solutionism Won't Fix Poverty. Boring AI Might.

**Subtitle: Why the "AI for Good" movement is often a dangerous distraction, and how the most boring AI applications can have the most profound impact.**

The headlines are intoxicating. "AI to End Hunger." "AI to Cure Disease." "AI to Save the Planet."

The "AI for Good" movement, championed by tech giants and celebrated at global summits, promises a future where our most intractable problems are solved by algorithms. It's a beautiful, inspiring vision.

It's also a dangerous illusion.

As highlighted in a recent WIRED opinion piece, these grand projects often smack of "tech solutionism"â€”the naive belief that complex social problems like poverty, crime, and corruption can be solved with a clever piece of code. They often amount to little more than high-tech beta tests on vulnerable populations, masking the root causes of the very issues they claim to address.

Think about it. An AI that can diagnose a disease from a medical scan is useless if there are no doctors to administer treatment, no roads to transport medicine, and no electricity to power the clinic. The algorithm works, but the system is broken. The project generates a great press release, but zero real-world impact.

This is the great distraction of "AI for Good."

It pulls focus from the real, unsexy work that actually makes a difference. The most ethical and impactful AI isn't the one that gets the most applause at a conference. It's the one that gets quietly deployed to solve a boring, operational problem.

Consider my experience in Uganda. We could have pursued a flashy project to predict crop yields. Instead, we focused on something far more mundane: optimizing the supply chain for essential medicines. We used simple automation to ensure that clinics didn't run out of stock, that deliveries were tracked, and that waste was minimized.

There were no headlines. No awards. But lives were saved.

That is the paradox of AI for good. The real good isn't found in a boardroom; it's found in the forums and communities where real business owners are "bitching and moaning" about their problems. The real good is often boring. It's AI that:

*   **Optimizes inventory** to prevent stockouts of critical supplies.
*   **Automates paperwork** to free up healthcare workers to see more patients.
*   **Improves logistics** to ensure goods and services reach the last mile.
*   **Cleans up data** to make government services more efficient and accountable.

These aren't the projects that get you on the cover of a magazine. They are, however, the projects that build resilient businesses, create stable jobs, and lay the foundation for a functioning society.

So, the next time you hear about an AI that's going to save the world, ask a simple question: Does it solve the root problem, or does it just create a good story?

Because the truth is, we don't need more technological saviors. We need more practical problem-solvers. We need less hype, and more boring, effective AI.
