# Fire Your Slowest Sales Rep. Hire a Bot That Never Sleeps.

**Subtitle: A step-by-step guide to building a 24/7 WhatsApp sales agent in 30 minutesâ€”for free, with no code.**

---

You can't be available 24/7. Your customers are.

Every missed message after hours is a potential lost sale. Every delayed response is a chance for a competitor to swoop in. You're losing money while you sleep, and hiring a round-the-clock team is a luxury most businesses can't afford.

But what if you could build a tireless sales agent that instantly responds to every inquiry, qualifies leads, and captures contact info on WhatsApp, the platform your customers already use and trust?

Today, you're going to do just that. Using a free, open-source tool called **Typebot**, we'll build a simple but powerful WhatsApp bot in under 30 minutes. No coding required.

### The 5-Step Plan to Your First AI Employee

**What you'll need:** A computer and a free Typebot account.

**Step 1: Design the Conversation (5 minutes)**

Before you build, you must plan. Map out the perfect sales conversation on paper. Keep it simple:

1.  **Greeting:** Start with a warm, instant welcome. "Hi there! Thanks for contacting [Your Business Name]."
2.  **Qualification:** Ask a key question to understand their needs. "Are you interested in our consulting services or our training workshops?"
3.  **Information Capture:** Get their details. "Great! What's the best email address to send you more information?"
4.  **Closing:** Set expectations. "Got it. Our team will be in touch within 24 hours. Thanks for reaching out!"

**Step 2: Build the Flow in Typebot (15 minutes)**

Log into Typebot and create a new project. You'll see a drag-and-drop canvas.

1.  **Greeting:** Drag a "Text" bubble onto the canvas and type your greeting message.
2.  **Qualification:** Drag a "Buttons" block. Create a button for each option (e.g., "Consulting," "Workshops").
3.  **Information Capture:** From each button, drag a new line and connect it to an "Email Input" block. This will prompt the user for their email and validate it automatically.
4.  **Closing:** Connect the email block to a final "Text" bubble with your closing message.

**Step 3: Connect to WhatsApp (5 minutes)**

Typebot has built-in integrations. Navigate to the "Integrations" tab and select WhatsApp. It will provide you with a QR code and instructions to link it to your WhatsApp Business account. Scan it, and your bot is live.

**Step 4: Test Your Bot (3 minutes)**

Send a message to your WhatsApp number. Go through the flow you just created. Does it feel natural? Is it capturing the information correctly? Make any tweaks needed in the Typebot canvas.

**Step 5: Monitor and Improve (Ongoing)**

Your bot is now your frontline sales agent. Check the Typebot dashboard to see the conversations it's having. What are the most common questions? Use these insights to refine your bot, add more options, and make it even smarter over time.

**You Just Built an AI Employee**

In less time than it takes to watch a TV show, you've built an automated system that works for you 24/7, ensuring you never miss a lead again.

This is the power of practical automation. It's not about replacing humans; it's about empowering your business to grow beyond the limits of your own time.

### The Advanced Move: The Pre-Qualify Campaign

This bot isn't just a passive lead collector; it's an active sales tool. Here's how to take it to the next level:

Instead of just waiting for leads, use this bot as a **pre-qualifier** for your sales calls. Run a low-cost ad campaign or a broad email blast with a simple call to action: "Have a question about [Your Service]? Ask our 24/7 WhatsApp assistant."

When someone engages with the bot, they've raised their hand. They've moved from a cold lead to a warm one. Now, your follow-up call isn't an interruption; it's a welcome conversation.

You're no longer a cold caller. You're the helpful expert who's following up on a conversation they started.
