# LinkedIn Post - CrewAI Story

---

I just published the story of how a $100 AI agent outperformed a $5,000 consulting project. 

Here's the quick version:

- **Consultants:** $5,000, 6 months, half-finished job ðŸ˜¤
- **My AI agent:** $100, 3 days, 3x better results ðŸ¤¯

The secret? I gave the AI a "PhD doctor" identity to validate medical content. It was a game-changer.

This approach proves that in the world of AI, creativity often beats cash flow.

Want the full technical breakdown, code details, and the 3-step framework I used?
