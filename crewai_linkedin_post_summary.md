# LinkedIn Post Summary - CrewAI PDF Extraction Story

---

Sometimes the best solutions come from the most unexpected places.

Like when a $100 AI agent outperforms a $5,000 consulting project. ðŸ¤¯

Here's what happened:

The Problem: We needed to extract medical sentences from hundreds of PDFs for an English-to-Luganda translation model in Uganda.

The Expensive Way: Hired professional data extraction specialists.
- Cost: $50,000
- Timeline: 6 months  
- Result: Half-finished job with inconsistent quality

The Creative Way: Built an AI system with CrewAI and local models.
- Cost: $100/month
- Timeline: 3 days
- Result: 3x more sentences with 95% accuracy

The Magic: I created a "digital medical team" where one AI agent extracts text and another acts like a PhD doctor to validate medical content. Real doctors then review everything through a simple one-click Streamlit interface.

Why this matters: While Silicon Valley debates $100M AI models, we're proving that understanding your problem deeply beats throwing money at it.

The most elegant solutions often come from creativity, not cash flow.

Your turn: What's the most expensive problem in your organization that could be solved with a $100 AI solution?

I'd love to hear about the "expensive problems" you're tackling. What would happen if you approached them with creativity first instead of budget first?
