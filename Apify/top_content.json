  "🎉 30 Years of Deutsche Telekom! 🎉\n\n500 guests, classical and modern music, sports, politics, two grand pianos (in Bonn and Hamburg) coming together for a piece of music, and an elephant. Yesterday, we kicked off the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Telekom with a festive event. We celebrated ourselves, and we were also celebrated a little: 200,000 Telekom employees worldwide.\n\nWho would have thought that the authority called Telekom would once become a modern company? Growing from 37 million to over 300 million customers worldwide? Increasing revenue from 34 billion to 116 billion euros? And rising from number six to the most valuable telecom company in Europe?\n\nOur journey has been one of transformation and design. It has been about decision-making and action. But above all, it has been about people. Like Ron Sommer, who visionary opened up new markets. Or Kai-Uwe Ricke, who took Telekom out of debt and made new investments possible. Or my friend René Obermann, who, like no one else, put our customers at the center of our operations. Most importantly, it has been the many Telekom employees who are with us today or who once were. Those who never gave up. Those who continually reinvented themselves and our company, even in the face of headwinds. Change has also left wounds. That is part of our history.\n\nBirthdays certainly evoke nostalgia and reflection. But not reflection that keeps us stagnant. Instead, reflection that serves as motivation. We, too, must reinvent Telekom every day. AI represents a significant revolution. If we use it wisely, we will become even more efficient, customer-oriented, and faster. Hopefully: unbeatable.\n\nMy highlight yesterday was the unveiling of the \"Gran elephant dret\" by Miquel Barceló. It symbolically represents what Telekom stands for: It is no longer \"gray and sluggish.\" Instead, it is colorful and agile, curious and playful. The elephant that now stands in front of the Telekom headquarters should remind us to \"Think again!\" It embodies the power of change and the courage to continually reinvent the future. Those who understand the art of making the impossible possible can also achieve remarkable feats.\n\nThank you to our guests, the Beethoven Orchestra with Dirk Kaftan, Walter Smerling from the Kunst und Kultur Foundation, Mayor Katja Dörner, Prime Minister (NRW) Hendrik Wüst, Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger, Minister Nathanael Liminski, Philipp Schindera , and everyone who contributed to the success of our festive event.\n\nThe \"T\" in the Deutsche Telekom logo will also continue to stand for transformation and technology, but also for trust and teamwork. And recently also for Törrööö!\n\n#DeutscheTelekom #30Years #Innovation #Transformation #ConnectingYourWorld",
  "McDonald's trusted an AI chatbot with 64 million job applications. Hackers needed just six keystrokes to access them all.\n\n➡️ I've seen plenty of security failures, but this one takes the McFlurry. Security researchers just exposed how McDonald's AI hiring platform left millions of job seekers' data vulnerable—protected by a password that would embarrass a middle schooler: '123456'.\n\n➡️ The platform, built by Paradox.ai, features an AI chatbot named Olivia that screens applicants through McHire.com. Researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered they could access 64 million application records simply by guessing administrator credentials. \n\n➡️ No multifactor authentication. No security checks. Just instant access to names, emails, phone numbers—everything applicants shared while desperately trying to explain their job experience to a confused chatbot.\n\n➡️ The breach reveals a darker pattern in our rush to automate everything. We're handing over sensitive human moments, like job applications, to AI systems secured with less care than your Netflix account.This incident crystallizes three uncomfortable truths about our AI-powered future:\n\n👉 Companies deploy AI for efficiency but forget basic security fundamentals\n👉 The most vulnerable data often belongs to those seeking entry-level work\n👉 Human oversight remains critical when machines handle human dignity\n\n❓ When we delegate human processes to machines, we inherit new responsibilities, not shed them.

  "What if the real disruption in manufacturing isn’t coming from AI, cloud, or automation... but from the uncomfortable realization that we’ve been investing in all the wrong things?\n\nAccording to Deloitte’s 2025 Smart Manufacturing Survey, manufacturers are pouring billions into tech. 𝟕𝟖% are allocating over 𝟐𝟎% of their improvement budgets to smart manufacturing. 𝟒𝟔% are prioritizing process automation. \nThe intent is clear. \nThe excitement is real. \n\nBut…. I would argue 𝐰𝐞’𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐲..\nNot in our culture. \nNot in our org structures. \nNot in how we prepare our people.\n\nThe data exposes the gap. Human capital is the least mature capability in the smart manufacturing stack. Only 𝟒𝟖% of companies have a training and adoption standard. Yet it’s the number one area they say they want to improve. And while 𝟖𝟓% believe smart manufacturing will attract new talent, more than a third say their biggest human capital concern is simply adapting workers to the factory of the future.\n\nWe like the sound of digital transformation as long as it doesn't slow us down. We like the optics of AI as long as we don't have to redesign how we work. We like talking about the workforce of the future as long as we don’t have to train the one we already have.\n\nSo yes, investment is rising. But if we don’t confront the outdated systems and assumptions holding us back, all we’re doing is layering expensive tech on fragile foundations.\n\nThe biggest barrier to smart manufacturing isn’t budget, technology, or even talent.\n\nIt’s us.\n\n𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐜𝐤 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐮𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭:  https://lnkd.in/e6_QsJcw \n\n*******************************************\n• Visit www.jeffwinterinsights.com for access to all my content and to stay current on Industry 4.0 and other cool tech trends\n• Ring the 🔔 for notifications!",

  "Leader’s perspectives I \"AI at Work: Transforming with Deloitte, SAP and AWS\"\n\n@Netra Saxena, Associate Director, Deloitte India, spoke passionately about how AI can be applied to real business processes, not just as a concept but as a value-driving engine across industries. She shared how these AI solutions are delivered using SAP BTP and how they can be seamlessly lifted and shifted to other hyperscalers to align with clients’ infrastructure preferences. A highlight of the session was the introduction of a new platform offering, AgentX, which enables end-to-end business process orchestration powered by Agentic AI. With AgentX, organisations can move beyond traditional automation and empower digital agents to reason, act and collaborate across systems.\n\nReal use cases showcased:\n• Smart reporting: Build real-time, on-demand reports with embedded insights, removing the dependency on static dashboards or BI teams.\n• Intelligent invoicing: Automate the extraction of invoice details from documents and trigger direct posting into ERP systems with validation checks, reducing cycle time and manual effort.\n• Concept to case: Turn ideas into structured business cases using GenAI, instantly capturing problem statements, benefits, dependencies and ROI narratives.\n\nTogether, these solutions show how AI is already delivering measurable results, helping organisations drive efficiency, agility and long-term strategic impact.\n\nVinay Prabhakar, Hemendra Upadhyay, Mazhar Khan, Pankaj Banarase, Anand Rajagopalan, Deepak Kagliwal, Rahul  Venkateshwaran, @Suja Savio, Gopinath Padhi, Manas Ketkar CA PMP, Hemant Kumar Dua, Satyam Jha\n\n#DeloitteIndia #AIatWork  #MigrateX #AIERP #ERPTransformation #AITransformation #AlliancesSpotlight",

The goal was always clear: identify and integrate strong, complementary companies that share our values and ambition.\n\nThis acquisition reinforces our commitment to expanding our capabilities and market reach. Over the past few months, we carefully analyzed the IT market and observed several potential acquisition targets. NPS stood out as a company with an optimal market share, healthy financials, and significant potential for further growth. \n\nThere are considerable opportunities in the Southeast Europe market, and we will continue to evaluate and identify target companies for our further market expansion, the ones that align with our company culture, products, and services, ensuring they are fit for our strategic development in the future.\n\nWe are excited about what lies ahead, and we’re even more excited to welcome our new colleagues from NPS.\n\nWelcome aboard!\n\nTo find out more about this strategic step, check out the link below: \nhttps://lnkd.in/djEas3F7",
  "Big news to share: Praxis Labs has been acquired by Torch!\n\nWhen Elise Smith and I first met 7 years ago, we connected on the basis that workplaces are not set up for all of us to succeed. And that we needed more human-centered and inclusive leaders to engage diverse perspectives, build resilient teams, and create better products and services for us all. \n\nI am forever grateful for that first coffee date, and the email that Elise sent the entire eng listserve (I see you GSB students emailing Stanford eng 👀) that sparked my interest. It was the start of our journey with Praxis Labs. While there have been many twists and turns – COVID, a bank run, politicization of DEI – the decision to believe in ourselves, in the potential for change, and in a better future is one of the best decisions I’ve made. \n\nJoining forces with Torch marks an exciting new chapter and opportunity. Praxis is built on the belief that real-world practice, personalized coaching, and concrete skills measurement can reshape how people learn, grow, and perform.  Heather Conklin immediately saw our vision and combined potential. With Torch, we’re able to connect human coaching and reflection with our technology to create a leadership intelligence platform that’s continuous, contextual, and connected to business priorities. That combination is how we help leaders — and systems — drive organizational transformation and sustained behavior change, at scale.\n\nI’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built—and deeply grateful:\n 👯 To the Praxis team, past and present: I’ve never worked with a group as diverse, quirky, passionate, and vibrant as you all.  Your brilliance, resilience, and heart fueled this journey, and I’m grateful to have made some lifelong friends through this. \n🤝 To our customers: Thank you for trusting two young women of color with some of the largest and most influential enterprises and for sharing our belief in a better way to learn and lead.\n 🌱 And to our investors and advisors: You all have helped me grow and lead with purpose, and I am so grateful for your advice, partnership, and belief.\n\nAnd enormous gratitude to Elise Smith, my cofounder and partner. We’ve been through many ups and downs in this journey – both personally and professionally – and thank you for being a constant source of vision, courage, and joy every step of the way.\n\nI’ll be continuing this work as Head of AI Product at Torch, focused on how technology can expand access to transformative learning experiences.

  "AI skills will be crucial for years to come. \n\n\nGreat post by: Andrew Bolis\n\n\nOriginal post below\n\n\n⬇️⬇️⬇️\n\n\nAI skills will be crucial for years to come. \n\nKnowing how to use ChatGPT isn’t enough. \n\nLearn these AI skills to future-proof your career: \n\n(remember to 🔖 save for later) \n\n1.

  "Everyone's building the same three AI products.\n\nAI SDR. AI meeting notes. AI chatbot.\n\n10,000 startups. 3 ideas. Zero taste.\n\nI see pitch decks every week. \"We're like Gong but with AI.\" \"We're Salesforce with a chatbot.\" \"We're the AI version of [insert any SaaS tool].\"\n\nLast week, a customer asked me for call recording features. I told him straight up:\n\n\"I am NOT a call recorder. You are offending me with these questions. I'm here to serve your customers.\"\n\nHe looked confused. Like I'd just told him I don't believe in gravity.\n\nThat's the problem. We're so obsessed with making AI do what humans used to do, we forgot to imagine what it could do that humans never could.\n\nTake customer success. Everyone's racing to build AI that writes better follow-up emails. But what if the problem isn't the email quality? What if it's that we're sending emails at all?\n\nWhat if instead of 10 touchpoints over 3 months, you could have one perfect interaction at exactly the right moment?\n\nWhat if instead of quarterly business reviews, you had continuous intelligence flowing between you and your customer?\n\nWhat if instead of \"scaling\" customer success, we reimagined it entirely?\n\nThis is what taste looks like in the AI era. Not copying what exists and adding a chatbot. But questioning every assumption about how business works.\n\nThe winners won't be the ones who build AI versions of old software. They'll be the ones who use AI to build things that were never possible before.\n\nThat's the difference between following and leading. Between copying and creating.\n\nBetween having taste and having none.\n\nStop building better note-takers. Start building better businesses."
