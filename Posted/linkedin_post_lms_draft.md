**üö® "We only serve clients with thousands of users."**

That's what the chatbot vendor told us when we desperately needed AI for a COVID response project in Uganda. We had a shoestring budget, a massive problem to solve, and suddenly found ourselves locked out of the very platform we'd spent months building on.

After deploying AI across 15+ healthcare projects in LMICs, I've learned that choosing the "best" model isn't just expensive‚Äîit can kill your project entirely.

Here's the framework I wish I'd had back then:

## **The $50K Lesson: Why Model Choice Can Make or Break Your Project**

**The Setup:** COVID was raging. We needed a multilingual chatbot for health information. The vendor's framework seemed perfect‚Äîuntil they moved the goalposts.

**The Crisis:** Months of development work suddenly required enterprise pricing we couldn't afford. The "free" version meant building our own APIs for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and training discriminative models from scratch.

**The Reality:** I ended up doing everything end-to-end‚Äîtech architecture, model selection, deployment‚Äîdespite not being a traditional developer. Because when you're solving real problems with real constraints, you adapt or you fail.

**The Outcome:** We delivered. But it taught me that model architecture isn't just about performance‚Äîit's about sustainability, sovereignty, and survival.

## **The 6 AI Model Types That Actually Work in Resource-Constrained Settings**

**üß† 1. The Generalist - GPT/Claude (For Complex Reasoning)**
- **Best for:** Medical report generation, complex diagnostic support
- **Reality Check:** $0.03/1K tokens = $30/day for 100 patients
- **Vendor Risk:** High‚Äîpricing changes can kill your project overnight

**‚ö° 2. The Local Hero - SLM (Small Language Models)**
- **Best for:** Symptom translation, basic triage, offline operation
- **Reality Check:** Runs on a $200 tablet, works during power outages
- **Sovereignty Win:** No vendor lock-in, no surprise pricing, no internet required
- **Personal Note:** This is what I should have chosen for that COVID chatbot

**ü§ù 3. The Efficient Team - MoE (Mixture of Experts)**
- **Best for:** Multi-language support, diverse medical specialties
- **Reality Check:** 5x faster than GPT-4, 70% lower costs
- **LMIC Application:** Handles English, Swahili, and Luganda in one model

**üëÅÔ∏è 4. The Visual Doctor - VLM (Vision Language Models)**
- **Best for:** Skin condition screening, X-ray analysis, wound assessment
- **Reality Check:** Processes images locally, no cloud upload needed
- **Success Story:** Reduced dermatology referrals by 40% in remote clinics

**ü§î 5. The Strategic Thinker - LRM (Large Reasoning Models)**
- **Best for:** Treatment protocol decisions, resource allocation
- **Reality Check:** Shows reasoning steps = builds clinician trust
- **Critical Need:** When you need to understand WHY, not just WHAT

**ü§ñ 6. The Action-Taker - LAM (Large Action Models)**
- **Best for:** Appointment scheduling, inventory management, follow-ups
- **Reality Check:** Automates 80% of administrative tasks
- **Game-Changer:** Freed up 4 hours/day for patient care

## **The Decision Matrix That Could Have Saved Me Months:**

**High Stakes + Complex Reasoning = GPT-4/Claude** *(but have an exit strategy)*
**Routine Tasks + Cost Sensitive = SLM** *(my COVID chatbot should have been here)*
**Offline Required + Basic Tasks = Local SLM** *(vendor-proof)*
**Multi-Modal + Visual Analysis = VLM**
**Need Transparency + Critical Decisions = LRM**
**Workflow Automation + Repetitive Tasks = LAM**

## **What Most Guides Miss: The Infrastructure Reality**

Working in resource-constrained environments taught me that the "best" model on paper often fails in practice. Here's what to consider:

- **Latency**: In rural areas, a 3-second delay kills user adoption
- **Offline Capability**: SLMs shine when internet is unreliable
- **Local Language**: Many models struggle with non-English contexts

**Case Study**: For a Luganda health chatbot, we had to fine-tune a smaller model rather than use GPT-4, despite the latter's superior English performance. Result? 85% user satisfaction vs. 40% with the "smarter" model that kept timing out.

## **Your Next Move**

1. **Audit your current use case**: Which of these 6 models fits your primary need?
2. **Start small**: Prototype with the simplest model that could work
3. **Measure what matters**: Response time, accuracy, and cost‚Äînot just "intelligence"
